For efficient web accessibility, ARIA roles must be used carefully and in concert with appropriate HTML semantics.

Formatting HTML: HTML formatting is accomplished by using a variety of tags and attributes to improve the way web content is presented visually. Paragraphs are enclosed in the <p> element, while line breaks are enclosed in the <br> tag. List items are constructed using <li> and either <ul> (unordered) or <ol> (ordered) in lists. <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> are used in tables for rows, data cells, and header cells, respectively. Layout structure is aided by the <div> and <span> tags' versatility in generating block-level and inline containers.
